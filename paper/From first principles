From first principles:

This is a scale problem

each problem boils down to the scale of infections

We show this the same way we show other time-based scale problems

line charts

We show the disease as growing bubbles on maps because that's how we think of it

It "grows"

This is a scale problem but at its heart, it is a transmission problem

this is represented in our charts as R0: the growth or transmission rate

how many people does each infected person infect

But we don't respond to this on a person to person (R0) scale.

	we just dont know who is infected so we can't yet do that.

	its an asymptomatic disease

we respond to it on a county to county, state to state, national scale.

we can hope to impact the R0 but that is with sweeping measures.

How can we better understand the transmission characteristics? (the core of the problem)

We must get down to the transmission level

traditionally this was done with interviews and trying to understand where each infection comes from 

Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

The key there is that there are many (due to the scale of the problem) for which we cannot identify their path of infection

So how can we understand spread without understanding the relationships and contact between people?

Genetics. Specifically Phylogenetics

Phylogenetics allows us to look at samples of the virus in each infected person and build out an understanding of how their virus is related to other samples

The study of phylogenetics results in a phylogenetic tree that can help geneticists understand how viruses evolve over time.

New methods can produce a phylogenetic tree of samples in near real time

This helps us understand the mutation relationships between samples.

But in order to understand transmission, we have to look at a bigger picture
