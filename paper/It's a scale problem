It's a scale problem
at the heart of any scale problem is a transmission problem
if you want to drive scale you have to drive transmission
if you want to limit scale you have to limit transmission
how can we limit transmission if we dont even understand what is happening
we understand the person to person transmission and how to limit that
but at the moment, our main source of understanding community spread and interstate and international spread is interviews
we ask infected people where theyve been and who theyve been with
but 'Community spread' means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
We can't understand the transmission within a community and even between communities if the spread is so dramatic that we cant keep up with our interviews
interviews are essentially a one step ledger. "where were you last"
Genetics gives us a much better picture
the mutations in the genome of a virus essentially form a ledger of where theyve been
if we can catch genome samples at each stage in the transmission chain, we can greatly understand where the virus moves and how it got there
but we cant
so weve moved to phylogenetics
this is the study of how similar genomes are from a probabalistic standpoint
we create a phylogenetic tree that essentially groups the genomes together
by augmenting this with location data, you can begin to see interactions between states
but if we put this in a format that is inherently about interaction and relationships, we can analyze it much better
enter graph databases
these let us really dig into the relationships between two genomes and understand some levels of where genomes come from.
this mirrors the transmission chain.
however, the way this is currently set up, this only tells us to shut down transmission between two genomes?
that doesnt make any sense
but augmenting this data with more layers, we can link those transmission chains to real locations: political divisions that can act.
if our response is based in geopolitics, we need to understand the data from that perspective.
thats where maps come in
